# Session : 8

## Objective

- Write a closure that takes a function and then check whether the function passed has a docstring with more than 50 characters. 50 is stored as a free variable - 200
- Write a closure that gives you the next Fibonacci number - 100
- We wrote a closure that counts how many times a function was called. Write a new one that can keep a track of how many times add/mul/div functions were called, and update a  global dictionary variable with the counts - 250
- Modify above such that now we can pass in different dictionary variables to update different dictionaries - 250

```
&nbsp;
- Write a test file, that tests all of the functions mentioned above + the other basic ones 
- Test file must contain at least 1 tests for each function
